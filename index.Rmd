Poor sleep practices are detrimental to human health and performance in all aspects of life. Unusual sleeping patterns are particularly common amongst college students, especially first-year students, who are adjusting to being independent adults for the first time. At the same time, these new college students are taking challenging coursework, on which their success or failure is highly consequential for their future. Therefore, understanding which sleeping habits are correlated with student academic success can be very useful in guiding student behavior. Additionally, it is important to know how sleeping behavior is correlated with demographic factors such as gender, race, and first-generation status, which could help inform university decision-making and resource allocation.

The primary questions we answer in this project are: 

* How are course load and GPA distributed in different gender, race, educational background and colleges?
* What are the main sleeping patterns seen in students over multiple measures of sleeping behavior? 
* What can we learn about the relationship between academic performance, demographic characteristics, and sleeping habits in first-year college students? Can academic performance be predicted using these variables?
