We want to address the following research questions among first-year college students:

* How are course load and GPAs distributed in different gender, race, educational background and colleges?
* How is course load related to GPAs overall, and in various groups?
* What are key sleeping patterns seen in students?
* What can we learn about the relationship between academic performance and different demographic characteristics and sleeping habits?
