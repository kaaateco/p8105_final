This data set includes four different measures of sleep: 

* `bedtime_mssd`:	Mean successive squared difference of bedtime, a measure of variability in bedtimes between consecutive nights
* `total_sleep_time`:	Average time in bed (the difference between wake time and bedtime) minus the length of total awake/restlessness in the main sleep episode, in minutes
* `midpoint_sleep`:	Average midpoint of bedtime and wake time, in minutes after 11 pm (for example, 364 is 5:04 am)
* `daytime_sleep`:	Average sleep time outside of the range of the main sleep episode, including short naps or sleep that occurred during the daytime, in minutes

## bedtime_mssd

```{r}

sleep <- read_csv("data/cmu-sleep.csv") %>% janitor::clean_names() 

sleep %>% ggplot(aes(x = bedtime_mssd)) + geom_histogram()


```

# total_sleep_time

```{r}

sleep %>% ggplot(aes(x = total_sleep_time, fill = cohort)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)

```

# midpoint_sleep 

```{r}

```

# daytime_sleep

```{r}


```
