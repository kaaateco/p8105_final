## U up? The Impact of Lifestyle Habits on the Sleep Patterns of College Students

UPDATE: For the completed project, we ended up finding a dataset that
contains real sleeping data and answering questions different from what
is described in this proposal.

The aim of our project is to understand how lifestyle factors of
undergraduate university students impact their duration and quality of
sleep. As graduate students, demographic factors like age and sex,
lifestyle factors such as physical activity, caffeine intake, screen
time, and hours spent studying, and how they relate to sleep duration
and quality can be applied to our own lifestyle decisions.

Some questions we’d like to answer through exploratory analysis are:

- What are the distributions of sleep hours and lifestyle patterns
  (caffeine intake, screen time, etc.) among university students?
- How are different demographic and lifestyle patterns related?
  (e.g. are people who are more active drinking more caffeine?)
- Are lifestyle choices related to sleep quality and duration? How?
  Which variables have the strongest associations?

Some intended final products are a dashboard with plots describing the
distributions of our lifestyle and sleep variables (and the
relationships between them), linear and logistic regression to determine
associations between these variables, and potentially the application of
more advanced statistical learning methods. All project results will be
consolidated and publicized on a website.

Some specific planned analyses include producing box/density plots of
numerical variables (sleep duration, sleep quality, caffeine intake,
etc.) potentially stratified by university year or gender, scatter plots
to illustrate how these variables are related, and linear regression
models of lifestyle variables against sleep outcomes. Additionally,
we’re interested in applying methods like k-means clustering and
principal components analysis to distinguish high and low sleep quality
groups. We anticipate that applying such methods may be challenging, as
it will involve learning new techniques and packages.

We found our data set on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arsalanjamal002/student-sleep-patterns).
It’s a popular synthetic dataset that was generated using the underlying
distributions of demographic, lifestyle, and sleep variables in college
students.
